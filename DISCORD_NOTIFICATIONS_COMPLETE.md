## 🧪 Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Quick Webhook Test (Recommended First)
```bash
# After deploying with environment variable
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-discord
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Discord webhook test successful!",
  "status": 204,
  "debug": {
    "webhookExists": true,
    "webhookLength": 121,
    "environment": "production"
  }
}
```

**Expected in Discord**: Test message with 🧪 icon

### Test 2: Real Order Test
1. Visit your live site
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Fill in details (use DC ZIP code: 20001)
5. Submit order
6. Check Discord for order notification

### Test 3: Check Vercel Logs
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

Look for:
- `🔍 Discord webhook check: CONFIGURED`
- `✅ Discord notification sent successfully`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **"NOT CONFIGURED" in logs** | Environment variable not set | Add `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` in Vercel settings |
| **Variable set but not working** | Old deployment still running | Redeploy application |
| **404 or 401 error** | Invalid webhook URL | Verify webhook URL is correct |
| **Timeout error** | Network issue | Check Vercel region/Discord connectivity |
| **Empty notification** | Webhook revoked in Discord | Create new webhook |

### Quick Diagnostic Commands:
```bash
# Check if variable is set
vercel env ls | grep DISCORD

# View recent logs
vercel logs --limit 50

# Test from command line
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-discord
```
