# Contact Capture + Email/SMS Notifications System

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

This document outlines the complete contact capture and notification system implemented for the Cann√® app.

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ‚úÖ
Created migration: `/database/contact-capture-notification-migration.sql`

**New/Updated Tables:**
- **`customers` table**: Added `marketing_opt_in`, `marketing_subscribed_at`, `sms_opt_out`, `name` columns
- **`notification_logs` table**: New table to track all email/SMS notifications
- **`orders` table**: Added `order_ref`, `amount`, `items` columns for better tracking

**To Apply Migration:**
```bash
# Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
psql -h [your-supabase-host] -U postgres -d postgres -f database/contact-capture-notification-migration.sql
```

Or copy the contents of `/database/contact-capture-notification-migration.sql` and paste into Supabase SQL Editor.

---

### 2. **Environment Variables** ‚úÖ
Documentation: `/ENV_SETUP.md`

**Required Variables:**
```bash
# SendGrid (Email)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=hello@canne.app

# Twilio (SMS)
TWILIO_SID=ACxxxxx
TWILIO_TOKEN=xxxxx
TWILIO_FROM=+12025551234

# Already configured
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://radtljksnoznrsyntazx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxxxx
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=xxxxx
```

**Setup Instructions:**
See `/ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions for SendGrid and Twilio.

---

### 3. **Checkout UI Updates** ‚úÖ
File: `/src/app/checkout/page.tsx`

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ Marketing opt-in checkbox with TCPA-compliant copy
- ‚úÖ Clear labeling: "Order Updates & Notifications"
- ‚úÖ Disclaimer: "Yes ‚Äî send me order updates by SMS & email. Msg & data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt-out."
- ‚úÖ Optional checkbox (not required, but recommended)
- ‚úÖ Integrated with existing form validation using react-hook-form

**User Experience:**
- Checkbox appears after Terms & Privacy section
- Styled consistently with existing UI
- Works with dark mode
- Mobile-responsive

---

### 4. **Notification System** ‚úÖ
File: `/src/app/api/place-order/route.ts`

**Email Notifications:**
- ‚úÖ Sent via SendGrid
- ‚úÖ Beautiful HTML template with Cann√® branding
- ‚úÖ Includes order number, items, totals, delivery details
- ‚úÖ Plain text fallback
- ‚úÖ Professional design with pink/purple gradient

**SMS Notifications:**
- ‚úÖ Sent via Twilio
- ‚úÖ Concise message with order number and total
- ‚úÖ Includes STOP instruction for opt-out
- ‚úÖ Automatic E.164 phone number formatting
- ‚úÖ Respects `sms_opt_out` flag

**Notification Logging:**
- ‚úÖ All notification attempts logged to `notification_logs` table
- ‚úÖ Tracks status (sent/failed), channel (email/sms), provider response
- ‚úÖ Error messages captured for debugging

**Fail-Safe Design:**
- ‚úÖ Notifications are fire-and-forget (don't block order creation)
- ‚úÖ Errors logged but don't fail the order
- ‚úÖ Works gracefully without credentials (logs warnings)

---

### 5. **Marketing Sync** ‚úÖ
File: `/src/app/api/place-order/route.ts`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Updates `marketing_opt_in` flag on customer record
- ‚úÖ Sets `marketing_subscribed_at` timestamp on first opt-in
- ‚úÖ Idempotent (won't update timestamp if already set)
- ‚úÖ Ready for future integration with Mailchimp/SendGrid Marketing

---

### 6. **Error Handling** ‚úÖ
File: `/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (already existed)

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Catches React errors and displays user-friendly message
- ‚úÖ Retry functionality
- ‚úÖ Proper logging to console
- ‚úÖ Used throughout the app

---

## üì¶ Packages Installed

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail twilio
```

**Dependencies Added:**
- `@sendgrid/mail` - Email notifications
- `twilio` - SMS notifications

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### Order Creation Flow

1. **User Checks Out:**
   - Fills in name, email, phone
   - Optionally checks "Order Updates & Notifications" box
   
2. **Order Submitted:**
   - Customer record upserted with `marketing_opt_in` value
   - If opt-in is true and first time: `marketing_subscribed_at` timestamp set
   - Order created with all details
   
3. **Notifications Sent (Fire-and-Forget):**
   - **Email**: Beautiful HTML email with order details
   - **SMS**: Concise text message with order number and total
   - Both attempts logged to `notification_logs` table
   
4. **Success Response:**
   - Order created successfully
   - Notifications sent in background
   - Customer receives confirmation on screen

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Set all environment variables in `.env.local`
- [ ] Verify SendGrid sender email
- [ ] Verify Twilio phone number
- [ ] Restart development server

### Test 1: Order with Marketing Opt-In
- [ ] Place order with your real email and phone
- [ ] Check "Order Updates & Notifications" box
- [ ] Submit order
- [ ] Verify email received (check spam folder)
- [ ] Verify SMS received
- [ ] Check `customers` table: `marketing_opt_in` = true
- [ ] Check `marketing_subscribed_at` is set
- [ ] Check `notification_logs` table: 2 rows (email + SMS) with status "sent"

### Test 2: Order without Marketing Opt-In
- [ ] Place order with different email
- [ ] Leave "Order Updates & Notifications" unchecked
- [ ] Submit order
- [ ] Verify NO email or SMS received
- [ ] Check `customers` table: `marketing_opt_in` = false
- [ ] Check `marketing_subscribed_at` is null
- [ ] Check `notification_logs` table: No new rows

### Test 3: Error Handling
- [ ] Temporarily use invalid SendGrid API key
- [ ] Place order
- [ ] Order should still be created successfully
- [ ] Check logs for error messages
- [ ] Check `notification_logs` table: status = "failed"

## üìä Database Queries for Verification

### Check Customer Record
```sql
SELECT 
  email, 
  name, 
  marketing_opt_in, 
  marketing_subscribed_at, 
  sms_opt_out 
FROM customers 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Check Notification Logs
```sql
SELECT 
  nl.*,
  c.email,
  o.order_number
FROM notification_logs nl
JOIN customers c ON nl.customer_id = c.id
JOIN orders o ON nl.order_id = o.id
ORDER BY nl.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Marketing Opt-In Statistics
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN marketing_opt_in THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as opted_in,
  SUM(CASE WHEN marketing_opt_in THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / COUNT(*)::float * 100 as opt_in_rate
FROM customers;
```

### Notification Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  channel,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(*)::float / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY channel) * 100 as percentage
FROM notification_logs
GROUP BY channel, status
ORDER BY channel, status;
```
