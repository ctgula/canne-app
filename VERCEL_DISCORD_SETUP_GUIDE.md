## Method 2: Vercel CLI (Advanced)

### Prerequisites:

Run the setup script we created:
```bash
cd /Users/ct/Documents/canne\ on\ cursor/canne-app
./setup-discord-webhook.sh
```

### Manual CLI Setup:
If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/ct/Documents/canne\ on\ cursor/canne-app

# Link project if not already linked
vercel link

# Add environment variable for production
vercel env add DISCORD_WEBHOOK production
# When prompted, paste: https://canary.discord.com/api/webhooks/1427448787596742698/LGa107la7ZAvY6kI-sXU4YyF-LUnxZB_eudCmJaLtEbsAQpaT68VqldWsohVG8cuq4tF

# Add environment variable for preview
vercel env add DISCORD_WEBHOOK preview
# When prompted, paste the same URL

# Add environment variable for development  
vercel env add DISCORD_WEBHOOK development
# When prompted, paste the same URL

# Verify it was added
vercel env ls

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Method 3: Quick One-Liner (CLI)

If your project is already linked:
```bash
echo "https://canary.discord.com/api/webhooks/1427448787596742698/LGa107la7ZAvY6kI-sXU4YyF-LUnxZB_eudCmJaLtEbsAQpaT68VqldWsohVG8cuq4tF" | vercel env add DISCORD_WEBHOOK production && \
echo "https://canary.discord.com/api/webhooks/1427448787596742698/LGa107la7ZAvY6kI-sXU4YyF-LUnxZB_eudCmJaLtEbsAQpaT68VqldWsohVG8cuq4tF" | vercel env add DISCORD_WEBHOOK preview && \

vercel --prod
```

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### 1. Check Environment Variables
```bash
vercel env ls
```
You should see `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` listed for all environments.

### 2. Check Deployment Logs
After redeploying, check the build logs in Vercel dashboard:
- Look for any errors related to environment variables
- Verify the build completed successfully

### 3. Test Order Flow
1. Go to your live site (e.g., `canne-app.vercel.app`)
2. Add items to cart
3. Complete checkout with test information:
   - Name: Test User
   - Phone: 555-1234
   - Address: 123 Test St
   - City: Washington
   - ZIP: 20001 (must be valid DC ZIP)
4. Submit order
5. Check your Discord channel - you should see a notification! üéâ

### 4. Check Server Logs
If notification doesn't appear:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Logs**
2. Filter by **Function Logs**
3. Look for order submission logs with Discord webhook status:
   - `üîç Discord webhook check: CONFIGURED` ‚úÖ Good!
   - `üîç Discord webhook check: NOT CONFIGURED` ‚ùå Variable not set
   - `‚úÖ Discord notification sent successfully` ‚úÖ Working!
   - `‚ùå Discord webhook failed:` ‚ùå Check error message

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Discord webhook check: NOT CONFIGURED"
**Solution:** The environment variable isn't set. Re-check Steps 4-5 in Method 1, or re-run the CLI commands.

### Problem: "Discord webhook failed: 401" or "403"
**Solution:** The webhook URL might be invalid or revoked. Create a new webhook in Discord and update the environment variable.

### Problem: "Discord webhook failed: 404"
**Solution:** The webhook URL format is wrong. Make sure you copied the entire URL including `/` characters.

### Problem: Notification not showing in Discord
**Solution:** 
1. Check that the Discord webhook is for the correct channel
2. Verify you have permission to view that channel
3. Check Discord server settings - webhooks might be disabled

### Problem: Variable shows in `vercel env ls` but not working
**Solution:** You need to redeploy after adding environment variables. They're only available in new deployments, not existing ones.

## üéØ Recommended Approach

**For quickest setup:** Use Method 1 (Dashboard)
- Takes 2 minutes
- Visual interface
- No CLI knowledge needed
- Just remember to redeploy!

**For automation/scripting:** Use Method 2 or 3 (CLI)
- Can be scripted
- Useful for CI/CD
- Version controlled setup

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [ ] Discord webhook URL is correct and active
- [ ] Environment variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` added to Vercel
- [ ] Variable added to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- [ ] Application redeployed after adding variable
- [ ] Test order placed successfully
- [ ] Discord notification received
- [ ] Logs show "Discord notification sent successfully"

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Keep webhook URL secret** - Don't commit it to git or share publicly
2. **Test in Preview first** - Create a preview deployment to test before production
3. **Monitor logs** - Check Vercel function logs regularly for any errors
4. **Set up alerts** - Configure Discord to ping you when orders come in
5. **Create separate webhooks** - Consider different webhooks for production vs. staging
