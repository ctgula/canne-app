# Test Order - The Right Way 🎯

## After Migration is Applied:

### **Step 1: I'll Monitor Server Logs**
I'll watch the terminal for:
- ✅ Order creation logs
- ✅ Discord notification attempts
- ✅ Email notification attempts  
- ✅ SMS notification attempts
- ✅ Any errors

### **Step 2: You Place Order Through Browser**
1. Go to: http://localhost:4000/shop
2. Click "Add to Cart" on any product
3. Go to cart (shopping bag icon)
4. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
5. Fill in form:
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Email: test@example.com (or your real email)
   - Phone: (202) 555-0123 (or your real phone)
   - Address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW
   - City: Washington
   - ZIP: 20001
   - **CHECK the "Order Updates & Notifications" box**
6. Check age verification
7. Accept terms
8. Click "Place Order"

### **Step 3: I'll Analyze Results**
From the logs, I'll see:
- ✅ Customer created/found
- ✅ Order created with order number
- ✅ Discord webhook status (CONFIGURED/NOT CONFIGURED)
- ✅ Discord notification sent successfully OR error
- ✅ Email notification sent OR error
- ✅ SMS notification sent OR error

### **What We'll See in Logs:**

**Success:**
```
🚀 New order submission started
🔢 Generated order number: CN-20250113-XXXX
✅ Customer created/found: [uuid]
✅ Order created: [uuid]
✅ Order items created successfully
🔍 Discord webhook check: CONFIGURED
📢 Sending Discord notification...
✅ Discord notification sent successfully
✅ Email notification sent to: test@example.com
✅ SMS notification sent to: +12025550123
```

**Failure (example):**
```
❌ Discord notification failed: 404 Unknown Webhook
❌ Email notification failed: Invalid API key
```

This way we can IMMEDIATELY see what worked and what didn't!
